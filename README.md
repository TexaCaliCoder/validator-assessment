# Welcome to Brado's Live Coding Challenge! 🚀
## The 💥VALIDATOR💥

Hello, intrepid coder! Ready to show off your React superpowers? This isn't just any coding challenge; it's a chance to make those keyboards clack and those minds crackle with the electric spark of code! 🔥

## What's This All About? 🤔

You're stepping into the arena of Brado's Live Coding Challenge, where your skills will be tested in the fiery crucible of React development. Fear not! We're using Material-UI, so at least your buttons will look fabulous while you work.

### Rules of the Game

- **Time Bound**: You won't have forever, but you'll have enough time to show us a glimpse of your brilliance. (30 ish minutes)
- **Resources**: Go wild! Use anything you can find online. Just remember to share your screen.
- **Expectations**: We don't expect perfection, just progress. Some tasks are tougher than others; we're keen on seeing how you tackle problems and not just the end results.

### Challenges

Here's where you'll see what we've cooked up for you. Don't worry; it's only slightly less complex than defusing a bomb while blindfolded.

- **Task 1**: Buttons have stopped working across the app. Resotre functionality.
- **Task 2**: The "RETURN HOME" button is now on the home page. It should be on the validation page. It's Also no longer returning us to the main app page. Restore functionlity
- **Task 3**: Our validation logic on the validation page has stopped working. We should have status messages for 3 cases. You will need to find a test card number for this. (see reference images for copy change if needed)
  - When a card number is not entered at all
  - When a card number is not valid
  - When a card number is valid
- **Task 4**: Our styling as been broken by interns, can you please fix it.
  - Validator needs adjusting to be more like our original layout. This can be seen from the the refernce images.
  - The background has gone missing. Please restore it.
  - While your at it will you upadte the colors of the text to stand out a little more.
- **Stretch**:
  - Can you show us some different animated transitions for when the compoents load. We are kind of tired of what we have.
  - We would love it if you would throw some of your own flare on our app. Change it up. Add something to it. Go Wild.

## Take a breath 💨

- **Stretch those fingers** — There's no physical exercise involved, unless you count rapid keystrokes as cardio.
- **Relax** — We're interested in how you solve problems, not just the solutions themselves.

## Conclusion

Get ready to have some fun and code up a storm. We can't wait to see how you tackle our challenges. Remember, it's not just about getting it right; it's about exploring and enjoying the journey. May the code be with you!
